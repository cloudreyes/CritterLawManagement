# ADR-0000: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a lightweight way to document why we made certain architectural choices, especially for future developers (including our future selves).

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard.

ADRs will be stored in `/docs/architecture/decisions/` with the format `NNNN-title-with-hyphens.md`.

## Consequences
- Architectural context preserved
- Decisions can be revisited with full context
- New team members can understand the "why" behind choices
